# Geometry Dash!

## Group Name: Gwuh Hawk Productions
## Group Members: Shafiul Haque and Jacob Guo

Welcome to Gwuh Hawk Productions! We are aiming to make the platform game Geometry Dash in Processing using Java. We plan on developing this game through loading pre set maps (levels) and having a square block character play through the level. The playing screen is 900 (width) by 600 (height) on Processing. Depending on what modes each level has to offer, the square block may switch to a rocket ship, upside down, backwards mode, etc. as the level progresses. The character will face obstacles in its path, such as triangles or colliding with objects, and interacting with these obstacles will cause the character to die and reset the game. In the home screen, the user will have the option to alternate between levels, see their progress on levels, and click the level of their choice. The ultimate goal of Geometry Dash is for the user to complete the levels successfully without dying.
